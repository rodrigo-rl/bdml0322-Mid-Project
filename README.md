# Kaggle Uefa 2020 + Streamlit

This is the Mid-Project of the course of Big Data and Machine Learning Course 

The idea of this project is to show some data ordered in different tables inside streamlint enviroment. 

In this case the data are the matches of the UEFA Euro 2020 from a kaggle database (https://www.kaggle.com/mcarujo/euro-cup-2020). The raw data should be filtered and cleaned up before using them with Python. The filtered data is going to be stored in MongoDB

After that, it is going to be created an API with Python to connect the streamlit enviroment with the data in MongoDB.

I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoy programming it!
